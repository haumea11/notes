*** DONE Contact Jeff of C. Express			   :computer_express:
  DEADLINE: <2015-06-21 Sun>
  Thinkpad X200t shipment, or something.  His guys don't want to work on it 
  because they're a bunch of wusses.
  
*** TODO Learn About FreeBSD		                    :personal:BSD:OS:
  DEADLINE: <2015-06-21 Sun>
  I want to understand what makes the BSDs a worthy OS for servers.  And what
  makes for a good server.

*** TODO Plan a Server Build (Ongoing)		   :personal:server:hardware:
  DEADLINE: <2015-06-27 Sat>
  Plan a simple server build.  No need for graphics; aim is stability, quiet
  Operation, and general usability.  Plans to be headless, since SSH is the
  best.
*** TODO Hiragana Memorization				  :personal:japanese:
  DEADLINE:<2015-06-27 Sat>
  Pretty Straightforward.  I want to know all the hiragana and possibly begin
  work on Kanji by this point.  Not hard.
