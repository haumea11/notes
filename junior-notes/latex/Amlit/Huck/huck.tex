\begin{itemize}
	\item Huck and Jim use picks and shovels, merely letting on that they are case-knives.  Evidence in this chapter mounts that the plan to get Jim out is little more than a game to Tom.  This is all acceptable to Tom.  
	\item Warning notes carved into stone something about jim all that
	\item Farmers chase Huck and Tom.  Tom is shot by the farmers, Huck is to go get a doctor.  Family and friends are really excited.  Sally asks Huck not to leave that night and he doesn't.  Jim is chained securely in the hut.
