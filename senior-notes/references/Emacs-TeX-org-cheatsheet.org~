** General Notes
*** On embedded LaTeX
The following snippets will be identified as LaTeX source code:

    Environments of any kind1. The only requirement is that the \begin
    statement appears on a new line, at the beginning of the line or
    after whitespaces only.  Text within the usual LaTeX math
    delimiters. To avoid conflicts with currency specifications,
    single ‘$’ characters are only recognized as math delimiters if
    the enclosed text contains at most two line breaks, is directly
    attached to the ‘$’ characters with no whitespace in between, and
    if the closing ‘$’ is followed by whitespace or punctuation
    (parentheses and quotes are considered to be punctuation in this
    context). For the other delimiters, there is no such restriction,
    so when in doubt, use ‘\(...\)’ as inline math delimiters.
