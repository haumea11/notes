\section{Unit 1}
\subsection{Change and the Scientific Method}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The change in the Crab Nebula was formed by an exploding star.  This
		was found throught the \underline{Scientific Method}.  
	\item To understand change, one must understand the types of change.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Faster, or slower.
			\item Visible, or invisible.
			\item Destructive, or peaceful.
			\item Lasting, or fleeting.
			\item Monumental, or small.
			\item Physical, or chemical.
			\item Biological, or inert.
		\end{itemize}
	\item The scientific method is a method for studying change.
	\item There are steps, obviously.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Observe and question
			\item Research and gather information
			\item Form a hypothesis
			\item Experiment, to design a test for the hypothesis
			\item Data and Analysis, in which experiment is run, and data is gathered
				and organized.
			\item Conclusion.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item A theory is an hypothesis proven valid under all conditions and
		scrutiny.
	\item A law is a theory proven even more valid.  It is ``infallible'' which
		is a super loaded term and I disapprove.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scientific Notation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pretty simple stuff.  A ``Standardized way of expressing values in
		science, consisting of significant figures and a power of ten as well as a
		unit.''
	\item Addition and subtraction go with decimal, Multiplication and division
		run with lowest sig figs.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data}
	{\bf Data} is Quantified attributes or characteristics of an item in an event
	of change---length, mass, time, or force.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Precision is data aligning with data, accuracy is data aligning with 
			the	truth.
		\item Measurement is a comparison to a standard.
	\end{itemize}
