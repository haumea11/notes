	\item Respiration: nasal/sinal/oral cavity -> trachea -> lungs 
		(through diaphragm and for bronchii)

\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
	\item[Abdominal Cavity] – The cavity divided by the diaphragm from the 
		thoracic cavity
	\item[Bronchioles] – Process oxygen
	\item[Diaphragm] - located beneath lungs, works with lungs to help 
		them expand.  When it contracts, it flattens.
	\item[Epiglottis] - small flap that covers the trachea when you 
		swallow.  It's the janitor of the respiratory system (Joyce).
	\item[Esophagus] - Takes food to the stomach in a wavelike motion 
		known as peristalsis.
	\item[Intercostal Muscles] - Move the ribcage out to allow room for breathing
	\item[Larynx] - Voice box
	\item[Lungs] - Sacs of oxygen
Oral Cavity - The mouth
Respiration - Breathing
Sinus Cavity - The cavity in the nose
Thoracic Cavity - The cavity in which respiration happens
Trachea - The pipe what you tend to breathe through.
\end{itemize}
