* Notes: Phonation and the Larynx
** Phonation - The making of sounds using the vocal folds
** Larynx - The "voice box," containing the vocal folds.
** Vocal Folds - known (incorrectly) as vocal chords.  They come together and vibrate, upon the passing through of air.
** Epiglottis - covers the trachea when swallowing, prevents you from breathing in food.
** Hyoid bone, a bone connected to no other bones but keeping together many other muscles.  U-shaped, as shown on the diagram.  Located in the very front of the throat.
*** FUN FACT: strangulation breaks the hyoid bone, which is how they tell forensically when someone has been strangled to death.
** Thyroid bone: shaped like a shield, influences the pitch, commonly known as the Adam's Apple.  Protrudes out your neck.
** Notes on the diagram (to be placed online, eventually.)
*** Pretty much everything is named there.
