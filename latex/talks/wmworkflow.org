* Abstract
* Window Management
** Standard (Stacking or Floating)
	Desktop metaphors, DEs, and floating WMs
	Menus and GUIs
** Tiling
	Tiling WMs
	Keybinds, lacks mouse use
** Dynamic
	Technically both, usually feels more like one
	or the other.
* Other Productivity tools
** DE menus
	Reminiscent of the Start Menu
	GUI, if you don't know what's on the computer,
	it's great.
** Bars
	Useful for system monitoring, and for things like
	clocks.  I tend to hide them, but it's personal
	preference.

* Eyecandy
** The fun part - compositors
	Compositors can do a lot of interesting things.
	Current favorite in the "make your tiling wm
	loo pretty" community seems to be compton, a 
	fork of a fork of xcompmgr.

** Other stuff I guess
	Modern DEs tend to put a lot of effort into
	the "polish" side of eyecandy.  This takes 
	a lot of resources but it looks nice.
