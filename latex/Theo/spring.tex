\subsection{``Page 123 What Would you Do?''}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[The Wallet] Assuming my current situation, if it's easy to get the wallet
		back to the owner I do so.  Carrying 500 dollars on oneself is foolish, but
		it's not my money to take.  Perhaps I place a small photograph of a frowning
		man in the wallet.
	\item[The Big Party] If they ask, I tell them.  I'm not going to lie to my
		parents, and I know they're going to ask anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
		But I'm not even really that interested in big parties like that anyway, so
		it doesn't really seem like something that would come up.
	\item[Sexist Remarks] I call them out on it, as I definitely have in the past.  
		I'm a pretty big feminist, and I'm not going to back down on something I 
		feel strongly about, like that.
	\item[The Test] Academic honesty is something I don't compromise on.  I would
		sooner take a zero on a test than cheat, but considering I've worked these
		problems anyway it's not a big deal.  It's sufficient to say I would turn
		down the offer.
\end{enumerate}

As a side note, I see ``conscience as a myth'' and have to question which 
figures they've found to deny the existence of a personal conscience.  Even
someone who thinks that organized religions use conscience as a tool wouldn't
try to claim that there is no such thing as conscience, just that it doesn't
come from God.

\subsection{``Page 124 in the margin in pink font under a Book Icon.''}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Conscience as superego, in that it's from a source that's not god.  I 
		don't actually see what's so wrong with this, because God is just as much a
		source of outside psychological conditioning early in life as authority is in
		most of the United States.  In my view of morality, good should be done for
		a love of one's fellow man, not out of fear of an all-powerful deity.
	\item This is conscience as majority opinion.  This is a flawed worldview on
		so many levels, but it's surprisingly common.  Anyone with this view of
		morality should seriously reconsider what they're doing.
	\item This is the hedonistic conscience as a feeling.  There is actually
		very little wrong with smoking marijuana, but the real fact of the matter
		is it's not a moral issue.  Joe is willing to take the legal risks and 
		social stigma associated with marijuana use, and it's his choice whether
		to do that.  I thoroughly believe marijuana is a non-moral issue, even though
		the drug does not appeal to me.
	\item I'm not sure how to report on something here, but the issue of racism is
		often dismissed with a sort of conscience-by-majority-opinion thing.  It
		can be seen in modern times with the racism (and religious discrimination)
		against muslims from the middle east.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{page 125 in the margin in pink font under a Heart Icon.}
	I've done very, very little in the past week.  I'm going to stretch it
	to include a school week as well.  Of course, I always do my homework.  I 
	never cheat on tests, so I was honestly taking every test I took this week.
