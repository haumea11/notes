\subsection{Why?}
	Colleges that have decent admissions tend to require an essay, and
it is a major part of an application.
\subsection{How?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Answer the question.
	\item Write a good intro, make the reader want to stay.
	\item Prove a single point or thesis.
	\item Make it easy to find the main idea and follow it from beginning
		to end.  
	\item Make it show who you are, not what you've done.  All the things
		you've done have shown up elsewhere in the application.
	\item Use vivid, specific facts and events.  Quotations, examples, and
		reasons are important to the development of an essay.
	\item Be specific, and use imagery with clear vivid prose.  
	\item Obviously, action verbs and description.
	\item Avoid clich\'e s.
	\item Don't lie to pander.
	\item Don't write a resume.  You already wrote a resume.
	\item Be succinct.
	\item Don't forget to proofread, and don't unnecessarily use lengthy
		words.
