* Chapter 3
** Characters introduced
   Many minor characters, including the mckeys and Catherine (Myrtle's sister).
** Introduction
   The introduction of this chapter is an example of the writing style Fitzgerald is known for, describing things in great detail while not being horrible like Victor Hugo.
   "By 7 o'clock, the orchestra has arrived..." uses present tense through the paragraph, using the present tense as it is a typical party rather than a particular one.  He goes back to past tense because he moves to a particular party.
   Most guests are not invited, they simply arrive.  Once there, they are introduced by someone who knew Gatsby, and then behaved wildly.  Guests are Crazy, disrespectful, like children.
** The Party in Full Swing
   Nick gets to the party, and wants to find Gatsby as he has never met Gatsby.  Meets up with Jordan, and the two sort of interact with other people.  Rumors rage about Gatsby and how he made his money.  Lucille tore a dress at a party and Gatsby sent another one to her in the mail.  This highlights that Gatsby doesn't want "any trouble with anybody," but this may be ridiculous.
   Lucille shivers, and everyone looks around for Gatsby.  Even people who have little to whisper about whisper about him, because of his propensity for being gossiped about but also because they don't want to be caught by Gatsby.
   Nick and Jordan leave the group from East Egg, as Jordan feels they are "too polite for her" and becomes frustrated.  They encounter the owl-eyed man, who is clearly drunk, and is particularly taken by the fact Gatsby's books are real.  They also haven't been read.  This is a jab at the society of the time, satirizing the upper class of the roaring 20s.
** Describing Gatsby
   Gatsby has a smile that makes you feel he is prejudiced in your favor, that seems to understand you as you want to be understood, but this is very much an act.  Gatsby puts up a front, and this makes him a more relatable character.  Gatsby wants to get close to Nick not just because he likes Nick but also because he wants to get closer to Daisy.  Gatsby goes on a Chicago call, which implies illegal behavior.  Jordan doesn't believe Gatsby having gone to Oxford.
** Continuing on
   Nick and Jordan are talking later, and Gatsby interrupts and wants to talk directly to Jordan.  Nick gets his hat, goes to the hallway, and sees Gatsby and Jordan come out of the library as Gatsby is saying something he is eager about to her before tightening into abrupt formality when people come up to say goodbye.
   Nick encounters on his way out the car in the ditch with Owl-Eyes in it.  This is a typical end to Gatsby's parties, as people tend to leave un-sober and unhappy.  A sudden emptiness and isolation comes over Gatsby and the house as the party is over.  There is a shift at the end onto Nick.
** Concluding
   Nick shifts attention to himself in order to show the passage of time, his own personal life, his experiences with the city and the fact that Gatsby's parties are not the only thing happening.  Nick says Jordan is incurably dishonest, she cheated in a golf match, lies often.  Jordan dismisses the idea she could be in a car accident, as "It takes two to make an accident."  Nick comments that if they are to get together he must get himself out of that "tangle" back home.  Nick says he is one of the few honest people he has ever known.  This is close to true, but not really so.
* Chapter 4
** Opening
   Nick talks in the beginning of the chapter about how he was keeping track of all the people at Gatsby's party. Chapter 3 had a third party, the one at Gatsby's (and technically, the format of the rest of the parties at Gatsby's that Summer.)  Uses an old time-table to write down the names, the date being July 5th, the day after independence day.  This has a bit of significance, considering the form Gatsby takes with the American Dream.  Nick begins to differentiate East Eggers from West Eggers.  There are people of mystery, snobs, violent people, criminals, drunks, politicians, a murderer's brother, a gambler, a man who committed suicide jumping in front of a subway train, a man who arrives with four women.  East Eggers have fancy, elitist sounding names (old money) while West Eggers have show business, gambling, suspect nature about them (new money).
** Gatsby and Nick
   Nick mentions that on the few times he has talked to Gatsby he has had little to say.  Gatsby reveals in this chapter that he was born into wealth, went to oxford, served in the war, lived in Europe collecting jewels.  Notes a tragedy that happened, but doesn't want to talk about it.  Gatsby is pretty obviously lying, but Nick doesn't really catch on.  The story is embellished to say the least.
   Nick says that he knew why Jordan thought Gatsby was lying on the "educated at oxford" bit.  Gatsby says he was trying to forget something very sad, and Nick wants to laugh because it just seems too unbelievable and trite.  "It was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines," said in reference to how Gatsby covers a lot of topics in brief and they sound a bit fictional.
** Into town
   They drive into town, seeing the valley of ashes and Mrs. Wilson (very alive and vital), and Gatsby gets stopped by a cop.  Gatsby takes out a white card and waves it, and the cop just lets him go through without a citation.  Thry go over the bridge, and a dead man passes them in a hearse followed by carriages with drawn blinds and "more cheerful" carraiges full of friends.  Town is producing dead men and police are corrupt.
** Lunch with Wolfsheim
   Wolfsheim is described as a small, flat-nosed jew with a large head and hairy nostrils.  He fixed the world series, is a gambler, and is obviously corrupt.  This further links Gatsby with corruption.  Talks of the old metropol, which is a nicer restaurant, has fond memories of Rosy Rosenthal being shot.  Wolfsheim thinks Nick is interested in a business connection, but Gatsby notes Nick is just a friend and quickly shuts up Wolfsheim.  Wolfsheim wears human molars for cufflinks, says Gatsby is very careful with women and would never look at a friend's wife.  
** Before the end of the Chapter
   The POV shifts to Jordan, and she says Gatsby and Daisy were in love, gatsby went to war, Daisy married Tom, got a letter from Gatsby, weird stuff.  Tom's never been faithful to Daisy.  Another car accident, Tom is a careless driver.  Little girls are singing.  Gatsby is the shiek of arabi, and is CREEPING INTO DAISY'S WORLD.  This is when Jordan reveals why Gatsby bought the house he did.  This gets connected to the reaching at the start of the novel.  This brought Gatsby alive to Nick, as it makes Nick realize why Gatsby is doing what he is doing.  This puts Gatsby out of the world of materialistic purposelessness, and makes Nick admire him more.  Jordan says he wants Daisy to see his house in the meeting.
** The chapter closes
   Evening winds down, Nick puts his arm around Jordan's shoulder.  "There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired."  Nick kisses Jordan, I think.
* Chapter 5
** Opening
   Girl in the epigraph is like Daisy.  The chapter opens at night and Nick sees all the lights on.  Gatsby comes up, invites Nick to Coney Island.  Nick says no, and they talk.  Gatsby offers Nick a position in his business (the illegal one) and Nick says "I realize that, under different circumstances, this might have been a crisis."  Nick realizes Gatsby is trying to do for Nick something in return for the setup of the meeting.  Gatsby sees nothing wrong with this mentality.  Given Gatsby's reputation, this may have a lot of money and some significant illegality.  Nick declines.
** Nick Arrives
   Nick notes the grass that Gatsby had mentioned.  Gatsby doesn't notice a thing, he has too much on his mind.  Gatsby is horribly worried.  Gatsby avoids Daisy at first, and tries to make it seem like he is just now arriving.  Gatsby is embarassed and nervous and almost childish.  The clock falls but Gatsby catches it.  Nick tells Gatsby he is acting rudely and like a boy.  When they return to the room things become a little more comfortable.  She's crying, he's glowing.  Despite crying, it is obvious Daisy is pleased.
** The return to Gatsbyopolis
   AKA Gatsby's house, he says he took 3 years to make the money to afford it but is reluctant to say how.  Is very abrupt to cover and stops himself.  Gatsby sort of scrambles to impress Daisy, and damn near revalues everything he owns based on Daisy's reactions.  They're in his bedroom.
   Gatsby throws shirts all over the place, Daisy is sad because of such beautiful shirts.  Daisy regrets not staying with Gatsby, he got so rich and is way cooler than Tom.  Gatsby mentions the symbolic green light, and realizes how it lacks the significance anymore.  Picture of Dan Cody, window, Klipspringer.
** Concluding
   Daisy is a dream, and Gatsby has been building her up for years.  It is impossible for her to live up to the standard he has set.
