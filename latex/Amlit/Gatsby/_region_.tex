\item This chapter focuses on the lavish parties thrown by Gatsby, and the one of them that Nick is invited to.
\item Chapter opens and describes the amount of citrus Gatsby goes through every weekend.  Several Crates, enormous amounts of orange juice.  This is because of the scale of Gatsby's parties.
\item Nick is invited to the party, which is something unusual in its own right, as people usually just show up or are brought by someone else.
\item Owl-eyed man, having been drunk for a week, is in the library because he thinks it may sober him somewhat.  He makes note of the fact that the books in the library are real, but that they haven't been read as the pages are still connected at the ends (as books used to be when they were new)
