\section{Background Information}
\subsection{American Drama}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eugene O'neill was the first ``important'' figure in American Drama.  
	\item Introduced realistic drama with the removal of the viewer by the fourth wall.
	\item Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams represent Realism and Realism combined 
		with an attempt at something more imaginative.
	\item Miller wrote Death of a Salesman, All My Sons, and The Crucible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Crucible}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Produced in 1953, about puritans and the salem witch trials.  This was in 
		parallel to McCarthy's Red Hunt.  God, I hate McCarthy.
	\item There was a belief in Salem in witches, seen as the Devil's helpers, and
		confession led to freedom from the devil's bonds.  Confusion in identifying
		witches came from shape-shifting and possession.
\end{itemize}

\section{Act One}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reverend Samuel Parris is a main character, play opens in his room.
		He kneels by his daughter's bed, she is lying inert.
	\item Act opens with a digression, and a discussion of puritans.  One
		point he makes about these people tend to mind others' business, and
		that this feeds the witch trials.
	\item The puritans believe that they light the world.  This has helped
		and hurt America in the time since.
	\item Miller says that the Salem Witch Trial developed from a paradox
		in whose grip we still live.  The issue is one of the theocracy, but
		the balance turning toward individual freedom.
	\item We return to a mid-forties Parris, who is a bad man.
	\item Tituba is a slave, brought from Barbados by Parris from when he
		was a businessman there.  Believed to be able to conjure spirits.
	\item Abigail is strikingly beautiful, an orphan living with Parris
		who is her uncle.  She is very dramatic.  She tends to seem like
		she's lying here, because of the way she's acting.
	\item Someone was running naked in the forest.  Abigail may have drank 
		blood.  They danced.
	\item Betty is lying unresponsive in bed, tries to fly when she wakes
		up.  She actually passed out, probably.
	\item Mercy is a merciless.  She's the Putnam's servant, is sly.
	\item Mary is subservient, naive, and lonely.  She's a bit of a foil
		to Mercy.
	\item Mrs. Putnam tends to be full of canards.
\end{itemize}
