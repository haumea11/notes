\begin{itemize}
	\item * searches
	\item gd and gD search
	\item other built-in motions.
	\item Seriously, get SkyBison.
	\item The new skybison is good but unavailable.
	\item Left and Right parentheses go through prose by sentence.  This
		is pretty damn useful stuff.
	\item Motions and operators.  They can also be made to the demands of
		the user.
	\item Paradigm apparently has a filter that'll run things through a 
		calculator.  Use sage-mathematics.
	\item < and > shift indentation.
	\item Once you use motions and operators, things start to make more sense.
	\item Using multiple registers is useful.  0 is the last one you explicitly
		copied.
	\item ggdG can delete the whole contents of something, apparently.
	\item Percent is the filename buffer.
	\item Ctrl-A increments.  p^Ayy will paste, increment, copy.
	\item Tags.  Super useful.
