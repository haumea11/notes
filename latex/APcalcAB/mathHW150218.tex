\begin{itemize}
	\item[5. ] Show that $f$ and $g$ are inverse functions analytically and graphically.
	$$ f(x) = \sqrt{x-4} \qquad g(x) = x^2+4 \qquad x >= 0$$
	\item[9 - 12. ] Match the graph with its inverse. 9 is c, 10 is b, 11 is a, and 12 is d.
	\item[17. ] Graph the function and determine whether it is 1:1 on its entire domain. $$ h(s) = \frac{1}{s-2} -3 \qquad h^\prime (s) = $$
