\begin{enumerate}
	\item Slope Fields are drawings with the slope at any given point, and can tell a 
		lot about a differential equation without solving it.
	\item A big reason slope fields are useful is that there are some differential
		equations we are unable to solve.  The handout has some examples and rules.
	\item Drawing out a slope field by hand is tedious and unpleasant, so don't
		do it unless you have to.
